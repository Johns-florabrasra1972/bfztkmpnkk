Just walked out of Gap. Not the store, the movie. My head's still kinda spinning, like when you've had too much...popcorn? There are crumbs all over this bench, and I just know they're stuck to my pants. Anyway, I'm typing instead of voicenoting because, well, who knows why. The seats were comically tiny, like sitting on a kid’s chair at a parents' meeting. Back is... definitely not impressed.

> Wow, okay, there's this scene with a bridge, no, a canyon maybe, people were jumping—no, flying—over it? Or was it all in their minds? Not even sure right now. It's like when you're sure you left your keys on the table but then they're in the fridge. 

Some sci-fi nonsense, where nothing made sense, but in a good way, I guess? Like trying to make sense of why cats always look like they own the room. My brain felt like a blender with random scenes—aliens or something? And I kept expecting a plot twist that never came... or did it? Gosh, my head is, like, balloons filled with jelly. And there's that sticky floor under the seats, my shoes making that weird noise with every step.

> Download the movie, for sure; I think, idk, Norman asked me last week if it’s worth it. He might find some existential gold there amidst the chaos. Though I'd rather watch the movie again with subtitles because half the time I couldn’t hear, with the noise like a beehive in a tornado.

Was there really a cat in a spaceship? Or did I dream that bit while blinking too long? And what was with the fog—so much fog, like someone left the dry ice machine running on max. The soundtrack was like someone drumming on pots and pans, which is probably my old neighbors in the kitchen.
